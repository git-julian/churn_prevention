Analysis of TelcoChurn
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.


For this project, I was interestested in demonstrating how churn modelling churn in a telco company could look like.

1)How does Churn look like in this particular example?
2)What is the impact of churn on the companies turnover?
3)What are the main driving facots that are associated with customers quitting their contract?
4)How well can a first model predict the churn target variable?


There ist one Notebook available showcase the work to the above questions.
Furthermore the data used in this analysis can be found as a CSV-File in the same folder.

The results are available here.
